This repository contains a demonstration of a subtle bug in COBOL related to the handling of implied decimals in PIC clauses.  The bug can lead to unexpected behavior during arithmetic operations or comparisons and is often difficult to identify because it may not cause immediate or obvious errors. The solution demonstrates how to explicitly define the decimal point to avoid this type of problem.
